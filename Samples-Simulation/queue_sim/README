# Queue Simulation (DES)

This document outlines two types of simulations for analyzing queueing and scheduling interactions and measuring performance.

## Queue Simulation

- **Run expovariate version**: Execute the simulation using `queue_experiments1.sh` and `queue_experiments2.sh`
- **Run weibull version**: Execute the simulation using `queue_experiments3.sh`
- **Description**: Uses either expovariate or weibull distribution to assign schedule delay.
- **Scripts**: `discrete_event_sim.py`, `queue_sim.py`, `plot_queue_q.py`
- **Output**: Data and plots are saved in the `data` and `plots` folders.

## SRPT Simulation (Extension)

- **Run**: Execute the simulation using `queue_experiments4.sh`
- **Description**: Uses Shortest Remaining Processing Time to assign a shorter job to the running server.
- **Scripts**: `discrete_event_sim_srpt.py`, `srpt_sim.py`, `plot_queue_q.py`
- **Output**: Data and plots are saved in the `data-srpt` and `plots-srpt` folders.

## AVG-Time Tables

- **Run**: Execute using `generate_table.py`.
- **Description**: Change `file_path` and `output_path` in `generate_table.py` to plot average time for CSV files generated by `queue_sim.py` and `srpt_sim.py` as `avg_time.csv` in `data` and `data-srpt` (see variable `output_avg_time`).
- **Output**: CSV tables are generated in `data` and `data-srpt` as `processed_avg_time.csv` and printed in the terminal.
- **TODO (opt)**: Add a value of Theoretical Time in `avg-time.csv` before executing `generate_table.py`.
  
> **Note**: If you want to extract new plots, you need to delete the existing CSV files; otherwise, the new data will be appended to the existing files.
