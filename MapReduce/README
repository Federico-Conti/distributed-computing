## Wordcount.py 
This Python code implements a program to count words in a text file using the simplemr framework for MapReduce. The program uses two classes to handle the mapping and reduction of data: `WordCount` and `WordCountCombine`, with the latter also including a combining phase to optimize the process.

### Executions
**Without Combiner**
- Only the `WordCount` class is used.
- The file `mobydick.txt` is analyzed, and the list of the 10 most frequent words is printed.

**With Combiner** 
- The `WordCountCombine` class is used.
- The process is faster and uses fewer resources, thanks to the combining phase.


## mean.py 
This Python code implements a program to  calculate the average of the 'Overall' values for each club. The program uses two classes to handle the mapping and reduction of data: `FifaMean` and `FifaMeanCombine`, with the latter also including a combining phase to optimize the process.

### Executions
**Without Combiner**
- Only the `FifaMean` class is used.
- The file `fifa21.csv` is analyzed, and the list of the 10 most frequent words is printed.

**With Combiner** 
- The `FifaMeanCombine` class is used.
- The process is faster and uses fewer resources, thanks to the combining phase.
